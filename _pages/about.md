Hello, I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Università Ca' Foscari Venezia, in the Department of  Environmental Statistics, Informatics and Statistics, since December 2024, under the supervision of Ilaria Prosdocimi. I completed a PhD entitled "Statistical Learning for Multivariate and Functional Extremes", at Telecom Paris, in the IDS department, under the supervision of Stephan Clémençon and Anne Sabourin.
